# Stand-Alone Scripts

While packages are an ideal format for common workflow tasks, gathering these functions into a user-defined library requires some organizational overhead.  For infrequent or one-off tasks, stand-alone scripts offer an efficiency trade-off.  As a developer, it requires less work to produce and publish a stand-alone script, but it often involves more work on behalf of the user to take advantage of this script in the future, such as changing the working drive or the path to references within the script.  Using a script effectively often requires more technical expertise on the part o the user to adapt the script to their purpose and environment.  

For the GIS Office, if we think that a script may be used more than once, or if the script encapsulates a workflow that may be readily adapted to similar tasks in the future, we include the code as a stand-alone script in the scripts repository.  The following sections describe these scripts, their original purpose or motivation for creation, and offers instructions and advice on how to adapt them for use in your own user environment.
