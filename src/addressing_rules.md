# Addressing Rules

[Chapter 6.40](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/DocumentCenter/View/39/Title-6---Grants-Pass-Uniform-Traffic-Code--PDF?bidId=) of the City of Grants Pass [Municipal Code](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/316/Municipal-Code) specifies rules of address numbering.  Please review this chapter prior to assigning new addresses to the city.  Although the section below summarizes the rules as they exist currently, the City Council may update and revise the municipal code over time.  If there is any conflict between the guidelines contained here and the current city code, please observe the municipal code and update this documentation to be consistent with current policy.
