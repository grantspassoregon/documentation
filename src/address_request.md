# Address Request Form

Check the inbox located adjacent to the entry door of the GIS office regularly for new Address Request Forms.  Developers submit Address Request Forms prior to or concurrent with seeking a new building permit.  For the City of Grants Pass, it is likely that new development occurs either within city limits or the urban growth boundary, meaning that the county assessor's office has already assigned the land a map tax lot, and the city already has an address associated with this property.  Developers apply for new addresses when dividing an existing property into two or more smaller lots, requiring unique addresses for service by the post office, utility companies, and emergency fire and medical services.
