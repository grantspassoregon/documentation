# Address Request Form

Check the inbox located adjacent to the entry door of the GIS office regularly for new Address Request Forms.  Developers submit Address Request Forms prior to or concurrent with seeking a new building permit.  For the City of Grants Pass, it is likely that new development occurs either within city limits or the urban growth boundary, meaning that the county assessor's office has already assigned the land a map tax lot, and the city already has an address associated with this property.  Developers apply for new addresses when dividing an existing property into two or more smaller lots, requiring unique addresses for service by the post office, utility companies, and emergency fire and medical services.

## Location of the Template Form

The template Address Request Form is located on the O drive at *"O:/GISUserProjects/Departments/GIS_General/Addressing/Address Request and Notification Forms/Address Request Form.pdf"*. Front desk staff keep copies of the Address Request Form in a file cabinet behind the service desk, including a clean copy used to print more copies.  If you update or change the Address Request Form, bring a new copy to the service desk and remove outdated copies from the file cabinet, so staff distribute the correct version to the public.

## Checking Incoming Forms

Before processing an Address Request Form, check to ensure the form is complete, including:

    - A date stamp showing when we received the document.
    - A payment stamp showing that we have received the addressing fee.  
    - Contact information, including the name of the developer, their address, phone number and email.  Do not confuse the contact address of the developer with the site address under development, they are not always the same.
    - A signature from the site owner.

Additional form information:

    - Minor or Major Address Request
        _ This field indicates whether the developer is partitioning the existing lot (dividing the lot into three smaller lots or fewer), or subdividing (splitting the lot into four or more smaller lots).
    - Reason for Change 
        _ The primary reason for new addressing is for new construction.  Development inside the Urban Growth Boundary occurs on pre-existing lots recorded by the county assessor's office, but previously undeveloped lots may not have address assigned, and the form provides an "Other" field for unanticipated circumstances.
    - The Assessor's Map Number field specifies the map tax lot number assigned by the county assessor's office.  This field may be left empty when the form lists an existing site address in the City records.
    - The Existing Address field lists the address assigned to the lot under development.
    - The Lot(s) Located field records whether the lot under development is within the Urban Growth Boundary or the City Limits.
    - The New Street Name Proposal field indicates whether the development includes the construction of a new street.
        _ New street names require approval of the public safety team.
        _ Extensions of existing roadways do not need to be listed on this field.
        _ This field may remain blank if the development includes no new street construction.
    - The Site Plan Attached field indicates whether the attached map is a site plan.  Subdivisions require a site plan, but partitions may substitute less formal maps indicating where the developer desires new addresses (such as a re-vegetation plan map).

## Site Plan Map

Attached to the Address Request Form is a map showing the tax parcel under development.  This map is typically a site plan, and will show the full boundary of the original tax lot, with additional lines showing the proposed partition or subdivision with numbered lots.  Each new lot will need an unique address corresponding to the primary access road serving the parcel.
