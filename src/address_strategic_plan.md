# 2024 Address Strategic Plan

The Address Strategic Plan identifies issues related to existing addresses, and serves as a planning document for developing policies and strategies for resolving these issues.  Address issues fall into four broad categories:

* Deprecated street names
* Address number suffixes
* Out-of-sequence numbering
* Inaccurate directional designation

Deprecated street names refer to addresses where the street name no longer corresponds to the street providing access to the property, and these present a concern for emergency response.  Emergency responders expect the street name of the address to correspond to the named public street that provides primary access to the property.

Address number suffixes, an identifier modifying the address number such as 1/2 or 3/4, present an issue for emergency reponders because the computer-aided dispatch system used by emergency response does not recognize address number suffixes.

Out-of-sequence numbering refers to address numbers that do not adhere to the numbering sequence established in the block.  According to the municipal code, address numbers should increase monotonically as they get farther from the city center.

The ostensible purpose of directional designations is to help orient emergency responders navigating the city at night, but unlike the previous issues, the problems with inaccurate directional designations do not originate from emergency response issues.  In this case the assessorâ€™s office differs from the City in recorded directional designation for hundreds of parcel situs addresses, and this document aims to provide clear process by which to change or confirm the directional designation of a street.

## Address Issues

### Issue: Deprecated Street Names

Affected addresses: 22 & 1007 SW Elm St, 1580, 1600, 1628, 1630 & 1632 Willow Ln

Description:    The City vacated SW Elm St in 1988, and yet two properties still have SW Elm St addresses, even though SW Elm St no longer exists (see Figure 1).  These addresses came to staff attention because of delays and confusion experienced during emergency response.  When SW Elm St was vacated, it was not removed from the City transportation map.  As a result, the CAD system routed emergency response vehicles through the former SW Elm St, who discovered it is now a gated private drive blocking access.  Existing SW Elm St addresses (22 and 1007 SW Elm St) need to be reassigned addresses using street names consistent with their primary access, defined as the first public street providing access to their private driveway.

The primary access to a property can change as development density increases.  Addresses that relied on a long private driveway to access a public road may find new access streets become available as a result of subdivisions created nearby.  In the case of 1630 Willow Ln, the creation of the Willow Glen Subdivision resulted in part of their private drive becoming Darin Dr, and now their primary access has changed from Willow Ln to Darin Dr, necessitating a change to a Darin Dr address.  Likewise, 1580 & 1600 Willow Ln previously took primary access from Willow Ln, but now take access from Esther Ln, and should receive Esther Ln addresses (see Figure 2).
