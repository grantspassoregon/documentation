# Missing Sidewalks

According to the City of Grants Pass development code, new street should have sidewalk adjacent on either side, except for the following cases.  Only one sidewalk is necessary if:
    - the street is on a hillslope, or
    - the street serves four units or fewer.

Currently a number of city streets lack the required number of sidewalks.  Older developments that predate the language in the development code may have omitted the construction of sidewalks.  Developers also have the option of omitting sidewalk construction using the Fee in Lieu Option, paying the cost of construction to the city instead of building the sidewalks directly.  The purpose of the Missing Sidewalks Map is to show areas of the city where sidewalks are currently required but not built.

To produce the Missing Sidewalks Map, first clone the *scripts* repository from the GIS Github account:
