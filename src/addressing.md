## Process Summary ##

- An **Address Request Form** arrives in the GIS office inbox.
    * The form includes a current address for the taxlot parcel under development.
    * The site plan indicates the number and location of partitions or subdivisions of the parcel.
- Assign address numbers to each partition or subdivision following the guidelines in the municipal code (GPMC).
    * Open the *Building Addresses* layer in ArcPro.
    * Create new points in the *Building Addresses* layer at each lot indicated in the site plan.
        - Enter the address information into the attribute table of each new point.
        - If replacing the existing site address, mark the old address as retired.
    * If the site plan includes a proposed new road or road extension, add a line to represent the centerline into the *Proposed Streets* layer.
    * Use the map template in the Layout tab to export an Address Notification Map of the new addresses.
- Complete a Tentative Address Notification form.
    * Use the *Address Notification Form* template in "G:\GISUserProjects\Departments\GIS_General\Addressing\Address Request and Notification Forms".
    * If there are too many new addresses to fit on the notification form, use the Excel file "Additional Addresses.xlsx" to record the overflow.
        - Open a new tab and label it to match the Address Notification.
        - Record the overflow addresses and export the tab as a PDF.
        - Attach the overflow page to the Address Notification in Bluebeam Revu.
    * Attach the Address Notification Map to the Address Notification in Bluebeam Revu.
- Email the Tentative Address Notification to the developer contact listed on the Address Request Form.
    * cc the planner whose initials are under the planning box checked in the "For Staff Use Only" section of the Address Request Form.
    * If the site plan includes a proposed new road, cc the public safety team.
        - Obtain the current public safety team group email list from the GIS Coordinator.
        - No need to cc the public safety team for road extensions, only for new roads.
