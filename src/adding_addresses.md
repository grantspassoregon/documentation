# Adding New Addresses

The City of Grants Pass stores addresses in GIS layer on the O drive, referenced by planning staff, utility works, commercial utility providers (like internet companies), as well as emergency fire and medical services.  The location of the layer file is at *"O:/Layer Files/Addresses/Building Addresses.lyrx".  The layer file references an Enterprise Geodatabase Feature Class that is stored on the *OUTRIGGER* server, called *"SDEPublic.GPGIS.land_SITEADDRESSPOINT"*.  To access this layer for adding new addresses, the GIS office uses an ArcGIS Pro project stored on the O Drive at *"O:/GISUserProjects/Departments/GIS_General/Addressing/Address Editing and Mapping.aprx"*.  This project includes the following layers:

- City Limits
- Urban Growth Boundary
- Proposed Streets
- City Streets
- Building Addresses
- Service & Annexation Agreements
- Taxlot Parcels
- Aerial Imagery
